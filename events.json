His debut album features double-barreled baritone vocals, electrifying honky-tonk hooks, Western swing two-steppers and country pop balladry, as Milligan uncorks exuberant themes of trouble-making fun, young romance and life-sustaining love. When it came time to unearth his very own sound, the Nashville newcomer turned to his roots: Texas. Growing up in Fort Worth and loving the outdoors as much as he loved music, Milligan\u2019s intent was always to sound like himself, as opposed to merely copying the sonic vocals and instrumentations of his heroes. While the family scrapyard business was never his Plan B, he still thinks of Texas as home and Nashville as his home base.",

        "description": "American country music singer-songwriter Nikki Lane discovered music as an outlet for creative expression at an early age. Mixing the honky-tonk atmosphere of vintage country with the clever bite of indie rock, her music is tough, witty and bold, inhabiting Nashville archetypes while upending them at the same time. Lane\u2019s songs walk a fine line between sincerity and irony, but the passion and effectiveness of her vocals keep her from sounding like a put-on, and her melodies mix rootsy twang and rock & roll edge with confidence. Her latest album is a raw and real offering at the crossroads of outlaw country, classic rock and seductive pop \u2013 the location Lane has been targeting from various angles since she first burst onto the national scene.",

The quartet \u2013 which includes frontman Dave Pirner, drummer Michael Bland, lead guitarist Ryan Smith and bassist Jeremy Tappero \u2013 continues to add to a catalog that illustrates Pirner\u2019s enduring gift for insightful songwriting that digs into the deepest, most vulnerable emotions. More than 40 years after Soul Asylum coalesced as a band, Pirner is the rare musician who pairs the confidence of a seasoned veteran with the unflagging enthusiasm and ambition of an artist just starting out. Buoyed by an energetic and unparalleled live show and Pirner\u2019s prolific songwriting, Soul Asylum isn\u2019t stopping anytime soon.",

It\u2019s easy to sway into the embrace of his breezy baritone stylings, warm guitar phrasing and untouchable charisma. His music is also an eternal bright spot illuminated by a belief that the kind of romance and love we used to see on the silver screen is still possible. Barely in his 20s, the singer, songwriter, guitarist and producer has already enchanted audiences everywhere. His breakout single \u201cUntil I Found You\u201d went Multi-Platinum, vaulted into the Top 25 of the Billboard Hot 100, and generated nearly 2 billion streams powered by the original piano version and duet with Gold-certified pop singer and songwriter Em Beihold.

He was even invited by Sir Elton John to perform \u201cUntil I Found You\u201d at Elton\u2019s last show ever headlining Glastonbury.Now, Sanchez spins a story unlike anything you\u2019ve ever heard (or seen) on his 2023 full-length debut \u201cAngel Face\u201d (Mercury Records/Republic Records) introduced by the single \u201cBe More.\u201d The record tells the tale of The Troubadour Sanchez, a fictional musician who blew up in 1958 with \u201cUntil I Found You,\u201d lit up popular culture, and was tragically gunned down in 1964 after falling in love with a mob boss\u2019 girlfriend, Evangeline. However, his long-lost debut has been unearthed 59 years later in the form of \u201cAngel Face.\u201d Now, Stephen has released the highly anticipated follow-up, \"Angel Face (Club Deluxe),\" out now.\n\n\nStephen Sanchez has materialized at the forefront of popular culture with a sound that\u2019s as timeless as it is necessary for the times.
