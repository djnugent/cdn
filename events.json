This exhibit will show how these systems create a resilient food shed and will explore ways we can all contribute to these sustainable systems.  Minnesota farmers and food-makers will be sampling their products. Kids will learn more about Minnesota-grown produce with hands-on activities.

of their genre, Nashville-based indie alt-rock band Moon Taxi is back with a sixth full-length album,\u00a0\u201cSet Yourself Free.\u201d\u00a0With tracks ranging from rock to synth to pop to bluegrass, the new lineup showcases what 15 years as a band gets you: a polished, classic sound without fear of exploration. The five band members stepped back into their roots to create an album primarily written and recorded by themselves. Despite a more fragmented process, the band regards\u00a0\u201cSet Yourself Free\u201d\u00a0as more reminiscent of their early work, citing it as fresh and exciting. They believe the album will become a fan favorite, something that will re-energize the initial fan base as well as draw in new listeners.
