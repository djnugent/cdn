The five band members stepped back into their roots to create an album primarily written and recorded by themselves. Despite a more fragmented process, the band regards\u00a0\u201cSet Yourself Free\u201d\u00a0as more reminiscent of their early work, citing it as fresh and exciting. They believe the album will become a fan favorite, something that will re-energize the initial fan base as well as draw in new listeners. Without a set sound in mind, the group was free to mold the record into what feels like an authentic Moon Taxi album.",
